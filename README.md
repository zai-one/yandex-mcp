# Yandex MCP

Yandex Direct, Metrika, Search, Wordstat and Webmaster.

Install it on your own computer or server and connect an MCP client. No AI Kit or
central ZAI platform installation is required. Provider credentials and API access
are required; provider charges and account restrictions still apply.

## Quick start

Install Python 3.12+ (below 3.15), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zai-one/yandex-mcp.git
cd yandex-mcp
uv sync --frozen --extra standalone
uv run --frozen --extra standalone python scripts/configure.py
uv run --frozen --extra standalone yandex-mcp --config mcp.local.json --check-config
uv run --frozen --extra standalone yandex-mcp --config mcp.local.json
```

The last command starts stdio and waits for an MCP client; it is not an interactive chat.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for credentials, client configuration, HTTP and package integration.
`--check-config` checks local settings only; it never validates a provider account over the network.

## Included in 0.2.0

Wordstat dynamics, regions and region tree use Yandex Cloud Search API credentials and the existing cost gate. OAuth onboarding and Metrika Logs export are future work.

Existing tool names and schemas remain supported. Writes and paid operations retain
their server policy and approval controls. See [runtime configuration](docs/RUNTIME.md).

## Verification

```sh
uv sync --frozen --all-groups --extra standalone
uv run --frozen --extra standalone python scripts/verify.py
uv run --frozen --extra standalone python scripts/verify_install.py
```

Tests use synthetic fixtures. A passing test run does not establish live provider connectivity.
