# Install and integrate Yandex MCP

## Install a release package

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and download the
wheel `zai_yandex_mcp-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl` plus `SHA256SUMS.txt` from [v0.3.0](https://github.com/zai-one/yandex-mcp/releases/tag/v0.3.0).
Compare the wheel's SHA-256 with the published checksum before installing it.
The wheel is platform-independent; Python 3.12–3.14 is required.

```sh
uv tool install "zai-yandex-mcp[standalone] @ https://github.com/zai-one/yandex-mcp/releases/download/v0.3.0/zai_yandex_mcp-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl"
yandex-mcp-setup --directory /absolute/path/to/my-yandex-settings
yandex-mcp --config /absolute/path/to/my-yandex-settings/mcp.local.json --check-config
```

The setup command runs in your terminal and keeps credentials out of command-line
arguments. It writes `mcp-client.json` and `mcp-client.toml` next to your configuration.
Merge the JSON entry into Claude Desktop/Cursor, or the TOML table into Codex.
For VS Code, reuse the entry under its `servers` object. Existing client settings
are never edited automatically. The snippet uses the installed Python executable
and an absolute config path, so the server can start from any working directory.

Windows accepts paths such as `C:/Users/you/mcp/yandex`; quote paths containing
spaces. If your shell cannot find installed commands, run `uv tool update-shell`
and open a new terminal. Keep the uv tool environment: removing it invalidates its
client snippet. After reinstalling or moving the environment, regenerate it with:

```sh
yandex-mcp-setup --directory /absolute/path/to/my-yandex-settings --client-only
yandex-mcp-setup --directory /absolute/path/to/my-yandex-settings --client-only --format toml
```

These commands only print client configuration. They do not read credential
contents, overwrite files, contact a provider or start a server. The checkout
workflow below remains available.

## From a clone or source ZIP

Follow [Quick start](README.md#quick-start). A source ZIP works with the same commands
after extracting and entering its directory. No `.git` checkout is needed at runtime.
The wizard refuses to overwrite existing `mcp.local.json` or `secrets/`.
For an existing setup, edit your files explicitly instead of rerunning it.
If a setup was interrupted, inspect and complete those local files; nothing starts automatically.

`mcp.local.json` contains an `env` object. Values are strings; only this service's
prefix is accepted. Paths ending in `_FILE` or `_STATE_PATH` resolve relative to the
config file. Explicit config values override inherited environment. There is no shell
expansion or automatic dotenv loading. Credential contents remain in private files.

The wizard configures Metrika first. To enable Direct, Webmaster or Cloud Search,
add their token-file paths from `mcp.example.json`; remove unused entries or leave them empty.
Search also requires the Cloud folder ID. For Wordstat, explicitly configure
`YANDEX_WORDSTAT_LIVE_ENABLED=true`, a positive `YANDEX_WORDSTAT_COST_PER_CALL`,
`YANDEX_WORDSTAT_MAX_COST_PER_CALL`, and principal/account monthly cost limits.
Those amounts are operator policy estimates, not a claim about the provider tariff.
All Wordstat methods use this conservative reservation policy, including region discovery.
Search jobs require a separate worker using the same config and SQLite state:
`uv run --frozen --extra standalone yandex-search-worker --config mcp.local.json`.


On Linux, private files need mode 0600 and private directories 0700. On Windows,
use private ACLs; the wizard restricts its new secrets directory to the current user
and SYSTEM. Pre-existing provider files require equivalent protection by the operator.
Keep SQLite state across upgrades. Never delete it to retry an unknown write.

## MCP clients

Use an absolute checkout path (forward slashes work in JSON on Windows, e.g.
`C:/Users/you/mcp/yandex-mcp`). Give the MCP client this stdio configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yandex": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/yandex-mcp",
        "run",
        "--frozen",
        "--extra",
        "standalone",
        "yandex-mcp",
        "--config",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/yandex-mcp/mcp.local.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the usual `mcpServers` format for Claude Desktop and Cursor. For clients
using a different outer schema, reuse the same command and args. The executable
`uv` must be on the client process's PATH; otherwise use its absolute path.
Do not run a second copy manually while the client manages its stdio process.

## HTTP

```sh
uv run --frozen --extra standalone yandex-mcp --config mcp.local.json --transport http --check-config
uv run --frozen --extra standalone yandex-mcp --config mcp.local.json --transport http --host 127.0.0.1
```

Configure `YANDEX_MCP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` with an RSA verification key and issue
RS256 JWTs from a trusted issuer with matching `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `sub`, `account_id`
and service scopes. [Runtime reference](docs/RUNTIME.md) specifies scopes and defaults.
Endpoint: `/mcp`. HTTP always requires authentication; use TLS for network access.
The local configuration check never generates a signing key or an access token.

## Python package and platform integration

```sh
uv build
python -m pip install "dist/zai_yandex_mcp-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl[standalone]"
yandex-mcp --config /ABSOLUTE/PATH/mcp.local.json
```

For reproducible integration, use the release wheel and verify its SHA-256; pin
the version and lock dependencies in the consuming application. The package can
also be consumed through its `create_server(ServiceConfig(...), transport=...)` API.
Keep secrets, account bindings and write approvals under the host's control.
Installing the package does not grant additional provider permissions.

## Verification

`scripts/verify.py` runs lint and offline tests. `scripts/verify_install.py` builds a
wheel, installs it into a fresh environment and discovers tools over real stdio
from an unrelated directory using synthetic settings. It makes no provider calls.
CI runs on Linux and Windows with Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14. Live provider account
validation remains an operator step after installation.
